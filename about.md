### Who are we?

We are a group of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology. The Online Learning Community is a research study of the space of Education and ICTD (Information and Communication Technologies and Development). Our team is comprised of students and faculty from the School of Interactive Computing, the College of Engineering and the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs.

### What is the OLC Initiative?

The OLC is a holistic model to incorporate mobile technologies into a larger online learning environment, primarily geared towards a low-resource context. Our model is centered on the design of an online, learning community with participation from students, tutors, NGO staff, and curriculum designers.

Our software includes a suite of tools that have been used as design probes and prototypes for the study of the space of education in low-resource contexts. We have performed multiple field deployments of our project in diverse underserved communities, and conduct an ethnographic inquiry of the impact of these tools on teaching and learning. We also study the feasibility of these ICTs for Education.

Please note that none of our software is consumer ready. This software is part of field studies with a strong focus on research, and our tools are not consumer-ready products.
